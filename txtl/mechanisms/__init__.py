# __init__.py - initialization of txtl mechanisms
# RMM, 26 Aug 2018

# This file is just here to force python to treat this subdirectory as
# a module.  Because mechanism names overlap, you don't want to import
# them.  Instead, access them as <mechanism>.<type> where mechanism is
# the name of the file in this directory where the mechanism is
# defined.
